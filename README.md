# Bash_Scripts
A collection of all the Bash Scripts i make for myself, descriptions below:

1. KillApplications.sh
  - Contains a list of applications that should all be closed
  - Checks if the application has any processes that are currently running
  - if there are applications open kill them
  - if there is no instances open display a message to terminal
  - Tell the terminal when the process is complete
  - (this is a simple modular for a larger project)
